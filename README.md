# Goal
The goal of Plant-Parenthood is to help users take better care of their plants. Users can log in, enter the names of the plants they own, and view information about sunlight, water, and growth cycles for each plant. They can also add plants to their personal collection within their account.

# Technologies Used
In our plant care application, we utilized a variety of technologies to ensure a robust and interactive user experience. We built a RESTful API using Node.js and Express.js, allowing for efficient handling of data retrieval and submission. Handlebars.js served as our templating engine, enabling dynamic rendering of HTML content. For our database, we implemented PostgreSQL along with the Sequelize ORM, which facilitated seamless data management and interaction. Additionally, we deployed our project on GitHub and Render, ensuring reliable hosting and accessibility. Our UI is polished, responsive, and designed to interact intuitively with users, offering an engaging and informative experience on plant care.
